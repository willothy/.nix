# Willothy's NixOS Dotfiles

I may move this into willothy/dotfiles when it's more usable.

I have just switched to NixOS, this repo is where I will be working on my Nix config that I will
hopefully use in some form or other across all of my devices.

Again, brand new to NixOS. I've only made this public to push myself to actually work on it and get
comfortable with Nix. I would not recommend taking anything in here as an example for your own config. There are
many great resources on the internet. Here are some I have found helpful:

- [Vimjoyer (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/@vimjoyer)
- [LibrePhoenix (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/@librephoenix)
- [NixOS Search](https://search.nixos.org)
- [NixOS Wiki](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Main_Page)
- [NixOS and Flakes Book](https://nixos-and-flakes.thiscute.world/)
- [Home-Manager Wiki](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/)
  - Don't miss the [list of all options](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/options.xhtml) in the appendices!
  - If you're not sure about a home-manager package's configuration, [look at the source](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/).
